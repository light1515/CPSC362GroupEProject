# CPSC362GroupEProject

This is the beginning of our employee management system. 

We will be developing an employee management system that serves as a way to simplify ways to work together as a team. Attributes and IDs will allow the site to redirect the user based on their level at the company. The project will be able to implement an employee management system that tracks and manages employee information. This can include SSN, ID, email, employee information such as Name, ID, role, and other relevant attributes. The goal for this project is to provide an easy way to manage employee data. Organization is TBD, possibly attribute or attribute-based, which may allow access rights or certain privileges based on employee role. General employee information would also be collected and organized. There could possibly be roles or positions added to the system in order to better define hierarchy and access. A possible system could be supervisor with employees being assigned to a supervisor. This project will also store vital employee info.
